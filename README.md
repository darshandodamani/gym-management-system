# Main objectives of the Application:

● This application allows the trainer to ensure whether the customers follow their training plan properly. It also helps us to monitor the total number of hours the customer trains for any given week and ensure that the workouts are performed consistently.

● The quality of training performed by all the customers can be monitored carefully by analyzing the data from various sensors in their respective smart bands. In the case of “Cardio Training” the trainer can monitor the improvements made by all the customers by analyzing their heart rate over a period of time. The body impedance data of respective customers can also be visualized graphically for understanding the body’s responses for the training.

● The trainer can make use of all the available data of that particular customer to prepare a suitable training plan for him/ her. Various training plans of all the customers will be handled for future reference. When a training plan expires the trainer will be notified automatically for the preparation of a new one.
